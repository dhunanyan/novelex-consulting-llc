// TODO: create an object for each of the subpages (not sub-subpages) which is a tiles section or even the image cards section and add it to each sub-subpage of that subpage
// Example: careers has 6 folders so this has to be an array of 6 objects with links titles descriptions image etc... - once this is done add that section to each of the careers/[folder]/page.tsx (as a 4th section - currently only hero, blank, iconCardsSection)

// TODO: change all the icons of the whole app (which are currently logos) to actual ones.

// TODO: Handle the load time of the images. They take too much time to load - probably should be compressed (as input - not in the runtime).
// PS: Should have a bash compressor installed already.

// TODO: Implement Contact button click - which should open a Modal containing contact info with social media links and Email etc.

// TODO: Create find your job list with a search bar and items inside of them - with a possibility to apply using form, which contains following fields: Name, Surname, Mail, PDF Document, Rich Text Box. This should be a Modal.

// TODO: investigate if can change the folder/page.tsx to [id].tsx dynamic route path - since there are lot's of code duplications.
// Investigate if this requires a client side render.

// TODO: investigate if there should be content changed somewhere

// TODO: create T&C, privacy policy, etc... pages
